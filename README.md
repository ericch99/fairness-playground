# Long-Term Effects of Fair Ranking
An exploration and simulation of long-term algorithmic fairness in ranking systems.

Research conducted under the *Signal Processing Algorithm Design and Analysis Lab*, University of Michigan, as part of a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) during Summer 2020.

## Contributions
* mathematical formalization of long-term ranking
* simulation framework for running fairness experiments on synthetic data
  - *stretch goal*: extend framework for use in existing datasets
* experiments comparing and contrasting the effect of various ranking and selection policies

See the final report (uploaded to the repository) for more details.
